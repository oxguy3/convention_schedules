# Convention Schedules
Collection of old schedules from conventions

It is remarkably difficult to find copies of schedules from past conventions/festivals. Convention organizers tend to remove last year's schedule from their website to make room for the next year's schedule. These schedules can often be invaluable for determining what happened at a particular event, and for figuring out the context of photos taken at these events. Thus, I'm doing my best to gather as many old schedules as I can in this repository.

If you have a copy of a schedule that I'm missing, please make a pull request to add it! (or, if you're not familiar with using GitHub, just [tweet me](https://twitter.com/oxguy3) or email me, haydenschiff at gmail dot com).
